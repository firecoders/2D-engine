# 2D engine
A C++ library, wrapping [sfml][2], to be used for 2D games

This library aims to provide a basic, reusable framework for building 2D games.
The project started out as a library for creating RPGs, but throughout the development
process, we figured that we should go with a more general approach instead.
This project is still undergoing heavy development and is not even close to
being finished.

We're using the [branching model by jbenet][1].
